# employee-tracker

## Description
  
To keep track of a large company with many different employees, roles, and departments, I took on the challenge of building an application that could perform routine CRUD operations on our database. Now instead of having to update information within MYSQL itself, we can update important information from the command line without having to use sql syntax. I learned how to perform CRUD operations on a relational database, different commands in sql, and how to implement async/await and promise based functions.
